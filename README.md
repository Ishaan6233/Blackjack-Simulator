# Blackjack-Simulator
This project is a command-line based Blackjack game built using Python. The game simulates a real Blackjack game, allowing players to interact with the game, view their cards, and make decisions to hit or stand. The dealer's behavior is also simulated to follow typical Blackjack rules. The project includes a custom card display to enhance the user experience.
