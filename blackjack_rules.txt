The game begins with the player and the dealer receiving two cards each.
The player's cards are dealt face-up, while the dealer typically has one card face-up and one face-down.
The player can see their own cards but not the dealer's face-down card.

The card values in blackjack are as follows: numbered cards 2 to 10 are worth their face value,
                                             face cards (jack, queen, and king) are worth 10,
                                             and an ace can be worth either 1 or 11,
                                             depending on the player's choice.

After receiving their initial two cards, the player has several options to choose from:

Hit: The player can request an additional card from the dealer to increase their hand value.
Stand: The player can choose to keep their current hand without receiving any more cards.
Double Down: The player can double their initial bet and receive only one additional card.
Split: If the player's initial two cards are of the same value (e.g., two 7s),
they can choose to split them into two separate hands and play each hand independently.
Surrender: In some variations, the player may have the option to surrender and forfeit half
of their bet if they believe their chances of winning are low.
Once the player completes their actions, it is the dealer's turn to play.
The dealer reveals their face-down card, and they must follow a specific set of rules called the "dealer's rules" or "house rules."
The most common rule is that the dealer must hit (take additional cards) until they reach a hand value of 17 or higher.
After the dealer completes their actions, the hands are compared.

The outcome of the game can be determined by the following scenarios:

If the player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the game.
If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, they bust, and the player wins.
If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the hand with a value closer to 21 wins.
If both have the same hand value, it results in a "push" or tie, and the player retains their bet.
If the player's initial two cards form a hand value of 21 (an ace and a 10-value card),
it is called a "blackjack" or a "natural," resulting in an immediate win, typically paid at a higher payout ratio.
"Blackjack" is a game that combines elements of strategy, probability, and decision-making.
Players aim to make optimal decisions based on their hand value, the dealer's face-up card, and the likelihood of the remaining cards in the deck to maximize their chances of winning.
